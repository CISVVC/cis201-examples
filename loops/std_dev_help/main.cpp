   Description: Mean and standard deviation. 
  This  program reads a set of floating-point data values.
  Choose an appropriate mechanism for prompting for the end of the data set.
  When all values have been read, print out the count of the values, the average,
  and the standard deviation.  The standard deviation is a numerically less stable
  formula as given in the text.
