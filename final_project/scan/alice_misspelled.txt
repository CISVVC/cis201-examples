  Alice was  to get very tired of sitting by her sister
on the bank, and of having nuthing to do:  once or twice she had
peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
pictures or convorsations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'
thought Alice `without pictures or conversashun?'

  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stoopid), whether
the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
Rabit with pink eyes ran close by her.

  There was nothing so VERY remarkble in that; nor did Alice
think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought
it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have
wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-
POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
her feet, for it flshed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a waistecoat-pocket, or a watch to
take out of it, and burning with curiositie, she ran across the
field after it, and fourtunately was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
